# e621-client
E621-client will be a browsing application for e621.net on iOS and Android (mainly iOS) made using React Native and Expo.

**Note:** This project is currently in early alpha, do not expect anything to work properly first-try. Nothing here is final for any potential release.

## Features
E621-client will have features and functions extended from their web-counterpart, including:
- easier post ordering and meta-filtering while browsing posts
- cleaner favorites list
- bookmarking posts (bookmarks will not be visible for other users)
- personal pools/postlists: you will be able to create lists of various posts to access them quickly
- settings i.e. safe mode, page length (amount of posts visible on one page) and blacklists

## Limitations
There are some things the API can't do yet, and thus can't be implemented. These include, but are not limited to:
- ~~Commenting~~
- ~~Reading comments~~
- ~~Voting on comments~~
(recently discovered that these *are* in fact available, but the API documentation doesn't mention them (thanks DonovanDMC!)

## additional information
### future plans
I probably will not open any beta testing channels soon because of personal reasons. Also, there won't be any builds at all for IOS for the next couple of years since I don't own a mac yet.
