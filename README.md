# e621-client
E621-client will be a browsing application for e621/e926 (and maybe other Booru sites) for iOS and Android (mainly iOS) made using React Native and Expo.

> [!Note]
> This project is currently in early alpha, do not expect anything to work properly first-try.

### Features
E621-client will have features and functions extended from their web-counterpart, including:
- easier post ordering and meta-filtering when searching
- cleaner favorites list
- bookmarking posts, pools, sets and forum posts (not visible to other users)
- private sets/postlists: you will be able to create lists of posts and access them quickly
- settings i.e. safe mode, page length (amount of posts visible on one page) and blacklists
- (custom?) themes

> [!Note]
> You may need to log in using your username and API key to favourite and vote on posts, but these will not be used outside e621.

## Setting up a development environment
> [!Note]
> I have not yet tested Android devices, and even if they may function, it will look terrible.
> The browser version also sometimes just decides to not work, so stick to iOS for now.

### Prerequisites
- Git (of course)
- Nodejs (latest LTS recommended)

### Setting up
Start by cloning the repository and opening the directory in your favourite code editor.
Make sure to run `npm install` to ensure all modules are installed.

### Starting
Currently this project only works with Expo Go (as far as I know) so to run it do `npx expo start` and use your browser or iOS device with the Expo app installed.

## Issues?
If you have any problems, message me using my email (`heijnisties@outlook.com`) or on Discord (`@tungstengamut`).
