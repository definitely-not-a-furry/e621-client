# e621-client
E621-client will be a browsing application for e621.net on IOS and Android made using React Native and Expo.

**Note:** This project is currently in early alpha, do not expect anything to work properly first-try. Nothing here is final for any potential release.

## features
E621-client will have features and functions extended from their web-counterpart, including:
-easier post ordering and meta-filtering while browsing posts
-cleaner favorites list
-bookmarking posts (bookmarks will not be visible for other users)
-personal pools/postlists: you will be able to create lists of various posts to access them quickly
-settings i.e. safe mode, page length (amount of posts visible on one page) and blacklists

## limitations
There are some thing the API can't do yet, and thus can't be implemented. These include, but are not limited to:
-Commenting, reading comments and voting on comments
-Voting on posts

## additional information
### future plans
I probably will not open any beta testing channels soon because of personal reasons. I expect this to be at around 2025 or maybe even later.
